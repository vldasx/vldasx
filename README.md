- 👋 Hi, I’m @vldasx
- I'm a Raw-Bat constructor. Soft robots for hard days. Maybe hard robots for soft days also, we'll see. 
Raw-bats name is reminder of a schewpeed bat eating event that gave us UNFORGETTABLE COVID TIME. 
The whole story stays in few words - two bots, a harvester and the driver. Driver is one big wheel, 
almost as a ball squished from sides. Harvester is a silicone bat-like soft robot size of a small dog. 
Entering the ancient great old forest where once agricultural land was. Driver parks under tree, harvester 
skilfully climbs up. Picks up fresh and ripe fruits and adds bag after bag to a driver. When the collecting 
of “goods” is finished, they leave carefully, silent and without a trace.
