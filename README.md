- 👋 Hi, I’m @vldasx
- I'm a Raw-Bat constructor. Soft robots for hard days. Maybe hard robots for soft days also, we'll see. 
Raw-bats' name is a reminder of a schewpeed bat eating event that gave us UNFORGETTABLE COVID TIME. 
The whole story stays in few words - two bots, a harvester and the driver. Driver is one meter wheel, 
almost as a ball squished from sides. Harvester is a silicone bat-like soft robot the size of a small dog. 
Entering the ancient great old forest where once agricultural land was. Driver stops under tree, branches 
and stones fly in the air, harvester skilfully slides up. Picks up fresh and ripe fruits and adds bag after 
bag to a driver. When the collecting of “goods” is finished, they vanish carefully, silently and without a 
trace. Old forest remains great and peaceful, sequestering CO2 and releasing oxygen.
